# Week 2: Time complexities

We talked about this before, but time complexities are an important part of informatics. It is easy to solve a problem correctly (imagine you have a program that tries every combination), but making them efficient is hard.

We have different data structures and algorithms that help us solve problems.

## Warmup problems:

Choose any of these:

- Robot Vacuum

- Palindrome
    - https://orac2.info/problem/1415/

- Missing Mango
    - https://orac2.info/problem/204/

If you have done all of the above: 
    - Archery
    - Snake Charmer

The easy way: brute force!
